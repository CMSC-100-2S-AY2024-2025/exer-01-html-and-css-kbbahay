                    My name is Kent Benedick A. Bahay, and I was born on 
                    July 25, 2004, in Taytay, Rizal. Our family now resides in Pasig City, Manila. I have three 
                    siblings, and I am the second child. My parents, Rosalie Adriano Bahay and Benedicto T. Bahay, 
                    have always been my greatest support system. <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed my elementary education at De Castro Elementary School in Pasig and proudly graduated 
                    from Pasig Science High School with pride and honor. After Senior High School, I applied for the 
                    DOST Scholarship Program to support my college education, as I would be studying far from my 
                    hometown. Fortunately, fate favored me, and passed both the UPCA and the DOST Scholarship Program,
                     which brought me to where I am today. <br><br>
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of the 
                    Philippines, an achievement that has equipped and honed me with the knowledge and skills. My college
                     journey was both challenging and rewarding, pushing me to grow not just academically but also personally. 
                     Throughout my academic journey, I developed technical expertise, analytical thinking, and a deep 
                     appreciation for innovation in technology. Additionally, my experiences inside and outside the classroom 
                     have strengthened my adaptability, collaboration, and critical thinking skills.
